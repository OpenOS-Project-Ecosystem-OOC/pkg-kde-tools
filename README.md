<!-- AI:start:what-it-does -->
This project provides tools and scripts to assist in packaging KDE software for Debian-based systems. It addresses tasks such as generating symbol files, managing build dependencies, and handling KDE-specific packaging requirements. It is primarily used by developers and maintainers working on KDE packaging workflows.
<!-- AI:end:what-it-does -->

## Architecture

<!-- AI:start:architecture -->
The project consists of tools and scripts for managing KDE-related packaging tasks. It uses CMake for build configuration and Perl as the primary scripting language. The architecture includes a set of Perl scripts, CMake modules, and auxiliary files organized for KDE packaging workflows. Key components include:

- **Perl Scripts**: Located at the root directory, these scripts handle tasks like symbol generation, dependency management, and copyright updates.
- **CMake Modules**: Found in the `cmake` directory, these define build and installation rules, including manual page generation and library installation.
- **Data Files**: Stored in `qt-kde-team`, `makefiles`, and other directories, these provide templates and configurations for packaging.
- **Manual Pages**: Generated from POD files using `pod2man` and installed into the appropriate directory.

Directory structure:
```plaintext

├── man1
├── perllib
├── t
├── *.pl (Perl scripts)
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── README.md
└── COPYING.* (License files)
```

CMake ensures dependencies like `PerlLibs` and `pod2man` are available. Installation paths for binaries, libraries, and documentation are configurable via CMake options.

cd pkg-kde-tools
```

## Configuration

## CI

<!-- AI:start:ci -->
The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The following workflows are defined:

1. **`build.yml`**:
   - Runs the CMake build process to ensure the project compiles successfully.
   - Validates the presence of required Perl dependencies and tools like `pod2man`.
   - No secrets are required.

2. **`test.yml`**:
   - Executes tests unless explicitly disabled via the `DISABLE_TESTS` option in the CMake configuration.
   - Ensures the integrity of the project's functionality.
   - No secrets are required.

3. **`lint.yml`**:
   - Checks for code style and formatting issues in the repository.
   - Targets Perl scripts and CMake files.
   - No secrets are required.

All workflows are triggered on `push` and `pull_request` events.
